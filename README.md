It's demonstration project for recruiters.

It's a work in progress, I update it as I gain knowledge. 
Please, take into account, that I work in cycles:
- I create some crude, ugly code, that gets the job done,
- I make code cleaner, by creating classes, methods, changing names etc.
You can check that yourself by looking into earlier commits.
Please check out more than one file if you want to see current level of my coding skills.
